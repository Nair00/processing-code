# Processing Code

## Visual Only

'Colorful_Rain' and 'Star_Field' are two apps that don't require any user input and they just visualize two ideas.

## Sort

A visual sorting algorithm. It generates a random array of integers and visualizes them under the form of blocks. Then it shows the bubble sort sorting algorithm. It currently supports speed change with 's' key (increase speed) and 'a' (decrease speed) and 'r' key for restarting. I plan to implement more sorting algorithms and add more user interactibility.

## Menger Sponge

Visualizes the Menger Sponge fractal in 3D. Click on the screen to grow in iterations. It does get pretty slow to generate anything after ~4 iterations, so proceed with caution (it is limited at 5 anyway, so it does not crashes).

## Lorenz Attractor

It draws the Lorenz Attractor and can be moved with the mouse so it can be inspected from various angles.

## sketch_2D_RayTracing

It implements the Ray Marching algorithm in a 2D environment. Move the mouse to move the ray coming out of the player and click on the screen to move the player in a specific position. You can also use 'a' key to add objects of random radius at the mouse position and 's' key to make the player follow the mouse.

## Game of Life

Basically it implements Conway's Game of Life. Click on empty squares to populate them and vice-versa. Press 'a' key to start the simulation and 's' to pause. You can change the size of the grid by modifying the scale variable (in code).
